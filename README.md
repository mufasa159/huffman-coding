## Huffman Project

Write  a program that accepts a string of text entered by the user. Program must accept any text. The output should be a list of each character in the text and its Huffman code. For extra credit also assign a code to `nt` and a code to `th`. Test your program with this input. Are there any important things meant about the subject?

Please do not use any library functions for obtaining the codes. Please use the Greedy Method shown in the book or similar. Please explain in detail how your program finds the frequency of each character and the frequencies of the two-letter groups, how these are sorted and how the code is generated. To get full credit, I should be able to test your program myself. Also show all source code. 

**DO NOT USE HUFFMAN PROGRAMS FROM THE WEB - THIS IS PLAGIARISM - AND WILL GET A ZERO.**
